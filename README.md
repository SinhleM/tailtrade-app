    A full-stack ecommerce platform for pet trading and pet supplies, built to support secure listings, real-time messaging, and admin-level moderation all backed by a structured relational database schema and clean UI/UX.
</p>
<p>
    TailTrade solves the challenge of creating a trustworthy, scalable customer-to-customer (C2C) pet marketplace by combining user access control, dynamic data rendering, and a normalized backend model to ensure data integrity and seamless user experience.

<h2>Why This Project?</h2>
<p>
    In unstructured online marketplaces, trust and data consistency are often missing. TailTrade addresses this by enforcing role-based access, structured data relationships, and real-time moderation delivering both functionality and reliability in a space that often lacks both. It also reflects real world backend thinking in terms of user roles, data modeling, and interaction tracking.

<h2>Project Information</h2>
<p>
    TailTrade enables customers to register, log in, and post pet or product listings with images, descriptions, and sale status. Admins have access to a real-time dashboard to manage reported content, sold listings, and view overall marketplace activity. A built-in messaging system links buyers and sellers directly through listing-specific conversations.
</p>
<p>
    On the data side, TailTrade‚Äôs backend architecture is centered around a normalized MySQL schema, with dedicated tables for users, listings, messages, images, transactions, and reports. This structure ensures efficient query performance, referential integrity, and scalable CRUD operations. Admin dashboards pull dynamic stats like items sold, listings flagged, and user reports, making it a great example of how data modeling supports application logic and moderation workflows.
</p>
<p>
    Although not designed as a traditional data engineering project, TailTrade demonstrates several foundational principles of data engineering, including relational design, dynamic data-driven interfaces, access control, and API-driven integration between frontend and backend systems.
